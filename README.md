# FriendTracker

## Introduction
This is initially an Android application for tracking Friend's activity. It is supposed to be a social network, where clients can create profiles and add friends. After establishing a friendship, the user would be able to see the current position of his friends and vice versa, the user's friends would be able to see the current position of the user itself. For this purpose there is a PHP server which provides all of the necessary services for the users.
